## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### New Files Created
1. `utils/streaming_analysis.py` - Real-time streaming system
2. `utils/change_history.py` - Undo/redo functionality
3. `static/js/streaming-cross-reference.js` - Frontend streaming interface
4. `static/js/approval-workflow.js` - Interactive approval system
5. `static/js/undo-functionality.js` - Undo interface
6. `static/js/relationship-graphs.js` - Visual relationship graphs (basic)

### Enhanced Files
1. `app.py` - Added streaming and undo endpoints
2. `agents/cross_reference_agent.py` - Integrated streaming support
